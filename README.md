# Data Science Capstone Project
### Longitudinal Analysis of Young Adolescents' Relationships with Family Members

*Clara Kim '23*

This capstone project is a continuation of my final project for STAT 318: Regression Analysis and Statistical Models from Fall 2022. My partner, Alice Zhang '25, and I used survey data collected by [Youth, Media & Wellbeing (YMW) Research Lab](https://www.wcwonline.org/Youth-Media-Wellbeing-Research-Lab/youth-media-wellbeing-research-lab), which is a part of the [Wellesley Centers for Women (WCW)](https://www.wcwonline.org/). Using wave 4 (2020) of this data, we fit a logistic regression model to identify the factors that are associated with a negative change in adolescents' relationship with their family members during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this capstone project, I extended my investigation to all 5 waves (2017-2021), visualized how the outcome variable changed over time, and fit a multiple linear regression for each of the waves.
